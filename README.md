# New Heterodox Mono

Monospaced adaptation of Old Standard TT.

Some years ago I made an adaption of the beautiful open-source font _Old Standard TT_ into a monospaced font
for my own use. I have been using this a lot as my programming font but haven't got time to improve it. It is
not perfect but since there are not much free choices of modern-style serifed monospace fonts (besides the
Computer Modern family) I decided maybe I should upload it in case someone finds this useful or wants to
help improving it.

I felt that it is very much non-"standard" in the computer science/programming community
to use such a modern-style typeface in programming, so I named it "New Heterodox" as opposed to "Old Standard".
Ironically, "Old Standard" was named as opposed to "Obyknovennaya Novaya" ("New Standard"), and now in
the age of computers, the old-time "New Standard" has become "New Heterodox", as in many other things in
design.

The typeface currently only have ASCII character set and there may be some slight inconsistencies in the
curves. For the purpose of programming it is pretty usable.

Further improvement may be to fix the anchors, make consistent the serif width, add back the
pre-composed accented latin glyphs, add blue values etc. in the OS/2 table (I think emacs uses
the blue value?) and maybe add italics and bolds. Also greek support would be nice - but adapting
the greek letters to monospace may be quite some work.



Here is a screenshot. Obviously nowaday this type of font for programming may not be everyone's cup of tea...
Anyway I wish someone who shares the same tastes can take over the development of this and make it a full-fledged
programming typeface - as there are no free alternatives on the market.
