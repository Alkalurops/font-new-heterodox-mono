# New Heterodox Mono

A Classicist Monospaced Typeface based on Alexey Kryukov's Old Standard TT.

Some years ago I made an adaption of the beautiful open-source font _Old Standard TT_ into a monospaced font
for my own use. I have been using this a lot as my programming font but I have never made it public or sell
it because I thought it was very imperfect. Yes, this is not perfect yet, but since there are almost no free
choices of modern-style serifed monospace fonts out there (besides the Computer Modern family) I decided
maybe I should upload it in case someone finds this useful or wants to help improving it.

I felt that it is very much non-"standard" in the computer science/programming community
to use such a modern-style typeface in programming, so I named it "New Heterodox" as opposed to "Old Standard".
Ironically, "Old Standard" was named as opposed to "Obyknovennaya Novaya" ("New Standard"), and now in
the age of computers, the old-time "New Standard" has become "New Heterodox", as in many other things in
design.

The design has been slightly modified from Old Standard to adapt to monospace - especially the proportion of
the letters, in this monospaced version, significantly deviate from the original. The letter 'f' and 't'
have a very unorthodoxical look with respect to the historical norm.

The typeface, at the current stage, is pretty usable for the purpose of programming, especially if you
only need Western European glyphs. Some currency signs are missing, though.

Further improvement may be to add more glyphs (for example, Polish is not supported yet), add greek
support (very useful for science/mathematics), add italic and bold.

Here is a screenshot. Obviously nowaday this type of font for programming may not be everyone's cup of tea...
Anyway I wish someone who shares the same tastes can take over the development of this and make it a full-fledged
programming typeface - as there are no free alternatives on the market.
